 * Overall Description
   2.1.
   Product Perspective
   CARMS is a self-contained internal utility application that interfaces with one or more external APIs.
   It will be an integral part of the internal operations toolkit, used by employees to manage access for external clients.
   It depends on the availability and stability of the external APIs it consumes.
   2.2.
   Product Features
   The major features of CARMS are:
   â¢	Request Management: Users can create, edit, and submit access requests.
   â¢	Approval Workflow: Designated users can review, approve, or reject submitted requests.
   â¢	Automated Provisioning: Upon approval, the system automatically calls the appropriate external APIs to fulfill the request.
   â¢	Dashboard & History: Users can view the status of their requests and a history of all requests they have access to.
   â¢	Role-Based Access: The application will differentiate between standard users (Requesters) and privileged users (Approvers).
   2.3.
   User Classes and Characteristics
   â¢	Requester (Standard User): Any internal employee who needs to request client access.
   They can create, submit, and view their own requests.
   â¢	Approver (Privileged User): Typically a manager or team lead responsible for authorizing access.
   They can do everything a Requester can, plus approve or reject requests submitted by others.
   They can view all requests within their purview.
   â¢	Administrator (System Admin): A technical user responsible for maintaining the application.
   They have access to system logs, configurations, and can manage user roles.
   2.4.
   Operating Environment
   â¢	The application will be hosted on the company's internal network infrastructure.
   â¢	The FE will be a Single Page Application (SPA) running in modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
   â¢	The BE (.NET) will run on a Windows or Linux server with access to the internal network and the internet (for external API calls).
   â¢	A relational database (e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL) will be used for data persistence.
   2.5.
   Design and Implementation Constraints
   â¢	Frontend Technology: React 18+ with TypeScript.
   â¢	Backend Technology: C# with .NET 8+.
   â¢	Architecture: The BE will expose a RESTful API for the FE.
   It should follow Clean Architecture principles and utilize design patterns such as the Repository Pattern and Dependency Injection.
   â¢	Database: Entity Framework Core will be used as the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM).
   â¢	Security: Communication between FE and BE must be over HTTPS.
   â¢	Sensitive data, such as external API keys, must be stored securely (e.g., Azure Key Vault, .NET Secret Manager).
   â¢	Code Quality: The codebase must adhere to industry best practices, be well-documented, and include comprehensive test coverage.
   2.6.
   Assumptions and Dependencies
   â¢	The external APIs for creating, editing, and deleting access are well-documented, stable, and available.
   â¢	The company has an existing identity provider (e.g., Active Directory, Okta) that can be used for user authentication (e.g., via OpenID Connect).
   â¢	An email service (e.g., SMTP server, cloud-based email API) is available for sending notifications.
   â¢	The format for auto-incrementing SSO usernames is defined and agreed upon.
   â¢	Network policies will allow the BE server to communicate with the required external APIs.

   â¢	REQ-3.7.2: The request status shall change to 'Processing' while the API call is in flight.
   â¢	REQ-3.7.3: The system shall map the CARMS Request Type to the correct external API endpoint:
   â¢	'Create Access' -> Calls External API for User Creation.
   â¢	'Edit Access' -> Calls External API for User Modification.
   â¢	'Delete Access' -> Calls External API for User Deletion.
   â¢	REQ-3.7.4: The system must securely handle authentication credentials (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens) for the external APIs.
   â¢	REQ-3.7.5 (Success): If the API call returns a success response, the request status shall be updated to 'Completed'.
   â¢	REQ-3.7.6 (Failure): If the API call fails or returns an error, the request status shall be updated to 'Failed'.
   The system must log the error response from the external API for troubleshooting.
   An alert should be sent to a System Administrator.
