I’ve created a comprehensive React-based prototype of the CARMS (Client Access Request Management System) that implements the key requirements from your SRS document. Here’s what I’ve built:
Key Features Implemented:
🔐 User Authentication & Authorization
	•	Role-based access (Requester/Approver)
	•	Current user display in header
📊 Dashboard & Request Management
	•	Clean, table-based view of all requests
	•	Status indicators with icons and colors
	•	Request filtering and viewing capabilities
✨ Request Lifecycle
	•	Create: New request form with validation
	•	Submit: Change status from Draft to Submitted
	•	Approve/Reject: Approver actions with required rejection reasons
	•	Processing: Automated external API simulation
	•	Complete/Fail: Final status updates
🔔 Notification System
	•	Simulated external notification API calls
	•	User-friendly success/error messages
	•	Contextual feedback for all actions
📱 User Interface Requirements
	•	Responsive design for desktop screens
	•	Intuitive form design
	•	Human-readable error messages
	•	Status-based visual indicators
🔄 Request States
The application handles all states from your state diagram:
	•	Draft → Submitted → Approved → Processing → Completed/Failed
	•	Rejected path with reason requirement
🎯 Core Functionality
	•	Request creation with all required fields
	•	Save as draft or submit functionality
	•	Approval workflow with proper authorization
	•	Automatic status transitions
	•	Notification triggers at each state change
	•	Error handling and user feedback
Technical Implementation:
	•	Frontend: React with hooks for state management
	•	Styling: Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive UI
	•	Icons: Lucide React for consistent iconography
	•	State Management: React useState for all application state
	•	Simulated APIs: Mock notification and external access API calls
The application demonstrates the complete request lifecycle while maintaining the user experience requirements specified in your SRS. It includes proper error handling, user-friendly messaging, and role-based functionality as outlined in your requirements document.
Would you like me to enhance any specific features or add additional functionality to better match your requirements?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
